# To-Do List Web App

This simple To-Do List web app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove tasks from the list. Here's an overview of the functionality:

- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on the checkbox (âœ“) next to the task.
- **Remove Task**: Users can remove a task from the list by clicking the "X" button next to the task.
